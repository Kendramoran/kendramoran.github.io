    <p id="my-poem">Hi, I'm Kendra.<br>
     I came out of a placenta.<br>
     I can be kind of extra.<br>
     </p>
     <p id="my-poem">As you can see I'm kind of funny,<br>
     I might as well make some money.<br>

    Greetings! My name is Kendra and this is my webpage. I'm a freshman in a big highschool and I'm really shy but I'm kind (if you don't get on my nerves) and I have a lot of friends. I like to draw and write poems on my free time and I also like to listen to lots of music and just dance </p>
    <p> As I said, drawing and poetry is my passion but I wouldn't want it to be my career. I hope that I become something in the future that will allow me to have enough money to raise my kids successfully and give money to my family.[<em>The poem at the top is just a little something that I wrote and there's an image below of what I drew before.</em>].</p>
